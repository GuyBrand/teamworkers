# Teamworkers
A demo that displays how to convert microservices into teamworkers

The code is complete and working
The readme is a WIP×¥

What's teamworkers?
------------

Team workers are a software development paradigm in which every worker may play a variety of roles dynamically.
In other words a worker is a combination of microservices linked into a singular service that allows from 100% microservice behavior to monolith behavior according to parameters or run time instructions.

Who needs it?
------------

Two very opposite types of developers:
1. Developers who do not have an experience with microservices and/or discouraged by the overhead needed in terms of orchestration or latency
2. Developers who use microservices, deal with the overhead and would like to find better, easier ways to cope in writing, vetting, testing and debugging process . 


Content
-----

This repo includes:
1. A sample of super basic microservices (basket and product) using a share library to initialize their CRUD like service case (micro folder).
2. The same two services after minor modifications, that will allow them to be bundles into a singular teamworker (workers folder).
3. a bundle that runs them as one (workers/glued).
4. some curl files to run a real external test of the functionality of the services and the worker.

A more detailed breakdown and walkthrough will soon be availalle
